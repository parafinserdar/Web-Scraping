MedlinePlus ---> 
In this code I've learnt that how to make web scraping using "BeautifulSoup" module.
I used string,requests,bs4,tqdn,json and click modules.
I've scraped https://medlineplus.gov/, I've scraped each drugs, each content.Eventually I transformed datas to json format.
Also I used threads.
I wrote many comment lines in my code so you can understand and learn web scraping too.

Amazon ---> I wrote this code in case you want to know when your laptop will be on sale. You can learn it whenever you want (dynamically) with this code. I know this code is a bit amateurish, if you want, you can do it by entering the URL of the product you expect to go on sale or by submitting the input process. I will also add the code that will send an e-mail when it goes on sale soon.
Good codings...
